# Alcohol-Detection-and-Auto-Headlight-Dimmer#
Intro:
As per some international surveys around the world, most of accidents occur at night time. 
These accidents are mainly because of driver inattentiveness while driving. 
Thus an autonomous car will ensure a safe and easy driving without much human intervention.

The effect at night time due to high intensity beam too is responsible for fatal accidents.
Thus, an automatic beam switcher helps to switch the high beam to low beam even when driver is inattentive, thereby preventing accidents. 

The project aims at developing a device or a system to sense the intensity of headlight
from opposing vehicle and switching the intensity of headlight automatically based on readings from sensor.
The operation of system doesn’t depend on human actions.


Working:
When alcohol is present we get high pulse.
When alcohol is absent, at that time “Have a safe journey” program is run through software.
This is the working on the some type of alcohol sensor using switch.

The power supply used is analog input of value 5v and 1A.
When power ON supply is provide to microcontroller, LDR, sensor. So microcontroller and all peripherals will becomes ON.
When alcohol is present, sensor sense and that time “Sorry but can’t drive ” program can be run by the software and
buzzer is ON for the time and display “Sorry but can’t drive ” on to the LCD.

IF there is presence of the alcohol, then red LED will be ON else the green LED will be turn ON.
LCD display is used for the display the result that alcohol is consumption or not.
Another part of the project that input us given to the LDR. 
That given information from the LRD can switch ON or OFF the MOSFET.

When the given output from the LDR is OFF then extra high beam will gives as the output. That is dipper will gives as an output.
If that LDR will gives that LDR ON then that will be gives the rise to the output as upper or the high beam.

Conclusion:
Driver behaviour is affected by many factors that are related to the vehicle, the environment and over the course of driving.
Monitoring and detecting the driver’s behaviour to ensure road safety is important because road accidents take place. 
Hence it is important to capture driver behaviour which will control the accidents and after effects caused by rash driving under the influence of alcohol. 
The proposed system deals with detection of Alcohol and Drowsiness using sensors and accordingly precautions are taken.
